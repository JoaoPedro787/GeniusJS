# Genius Game - React JS

## Description

This is a **Genius** game project developed with **React JS**, challenging players to memorize and repeat color sequences in increasing order. The game becomes progressively harder as the player successfully completes each sequence.

The goal of this project is to practice and understand the fundamental concepts of React, such as **functional components**, **state management**, **hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `Context`), and handling user interaction in an interactive interface.

## Features

- The game starts with a simple color sequence.
- The sequence grows longer as the player correctly repeats the colors in order.
- The player loses if they make a mistake in the sequence.
- The interface is responsive and interactive.
